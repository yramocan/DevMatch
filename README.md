# Dev Match

DevMatch is an online Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) community where developers and entrepreneurs meet to network, collaborate, and share ideas. This site has a "freemium" model where users can choose either a basic membership or a pro membership.

#### Basic Members
- Can access the community
- Can view basic information about others

#### Pro Members
- Can access the community
- Can view basic information about others
- Can view contact information for others

This site was made with Ruby on Rails. All sensitive information is hashed, salted, and secure. Payment information is never handled on the server and is handled by Stripe only with authorization of secure tokens.

### API References
- Stripe for payment processing
- SendGrid for sending emails

## Notes

Dev Match is my first project with Ruby on Rails. This is not a serious business idea, so do not pay for the pro membership unless you just want to give me money ;).
